Early approaches in automated ideology classification predominantly formulated the problem as binary classification or focused on identifying extreme partisan viewpoints (hyper-partisan news) \citep{hube2018detecting, semeval2019hyperpartisan, krieger2022daroberta, lin2024inditag}. The literature is distinguished by granularity of analysis: while substantial research has focused on \textit{sentence-level} bias detection \citep{spinde2021mbic,spinde2021babe, menzner2025biasscanner}, identifying specific biased phrases or sentences, these approaches often fail to capture broader contextual or cumulative framing effects across entire articles. Article-level classification approaches, which we adopt in this work, consider the holistic political orientation of texts.
