\chapter{Limitations and Future Directions}
\label{ch:limitations-future-work}

This chapter provides an assessment of the limitations inherent in our research methodology and empirical findings, followed by a systematic identification of promising directions for future investigation. We examine both technical constraints and conceptual boundaries that circumscribe the generalizability of our contributions, while outlining specific research trajectories that could address these limitations and extend our theoretical and practical understanding of computational political bias detection.
