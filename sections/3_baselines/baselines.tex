\chapter{Experimental Baselines}
\label{sec:baselines}

This chapter establishes baseline performance of three distinct classes of systems on the AllSides political bias classification task: human annotators, fine-tuned transformer architectures, and large language models in zero-shot configuration. Our transformer experiments design addresses the challenge of source leakage by employing a data split where all articles from the same source are contained within a single partition. As no fine-tuning is performed for LLMs, they are evaluated only on this source-controlled split to ensure consistency, and the human baseline study is conducted on a subset of this split as well.
