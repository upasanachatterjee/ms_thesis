\section{Problem Statement and Research Questions}

This thesis addresses the challenge of automatic political ideology classification at the article level, with particular focus on leveraging metalinguistic features to improve classification performance. The research is motivated by four key limitations in existing work: (1) the lack of comprehensive human baseline studies for article-level political bias classification, (2) limited exploration of metalinguistic features for ideology detection, (3) insufficient evaluation of modern large language models on this task, and (4) the absence of causal analysis examining how specific thematic and tonal features influence ideological classification.

Specifically, this work investigates four interconnected research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Human Performance Baseline}: What level of classification accuracy can human annotators achieve when identifying political ideology from article content alone, and how does this baseline inform the evaluation of automated approaches?

    \item \textbf{Metalinguistic Feature Integration}: How effectively can article-level metalinguistic features, particularly thematic and tonal characteristics, be incorporated into transformer-based models to improve political bias classification performance?

    \item \textbf{Large Language Model Evaluation}: How do contemporary large language models, evaluated in both zero-shot and fine-tuned configurations, compare to specialized transformer architectures designed for political bias detection?

    \item \textbf{Causal Analysis of Theme-Tone-Ideology Relationships}: What are the causal effects of specific thematic and tonal features on political ideology classification, and how do automated systems differ from human expert annotators in their sensitivity to these features?
\end{enumerate}
