\section{Thesis Organization}

The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows. Chapter~\ref{sec:relatedwork} surveys related work in computational bias detection, transformer-based text classification, and metalinguistic feature extraction. Chapter~\ref{sec:baselines} establishes experimental baselines through human annotation studies and evaluation of existing transformer and large language model approaches. Chapter~\ref{sec:dataset} describes our extensions to the AllSides dataset and the integration of metalinguistic features. Chapter~\ref{sec:continued-pretraining} details our continued pre-training methodology incorporating metalinguistic auxiliary objectives. Chapter~\ref{sec:llm-finetuning} presents comprehensive experiments with fine-tuned large language models and prompt optimization techniques. Chapter~\ref{ch:causal-inference} provides a causal analysis of theme-tone-ideology relationships, comparing human expert annotations with automated system outputs to identify systematic biases and feature dependencies in computational approaches. Chapter~\ref{ch:discussion} analyzes and discusses the experimental results, comparing the effectiveness of different approaches. Chapter~\ref{ch:limitations-future-work} conclude with directions for future research and acknowledgment of current limitations.
