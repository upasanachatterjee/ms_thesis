\chapter{Metalinguistic Feature Integration for Political Bias Classification}
\label{sec:continued-pretraining}

This chapter presents our primary technical contribution: a novel multi-task learning framework that integrates metalinguistic features into transformer-based political bias classification through continued pre-training. We extend the established triplet-loss methodology with auxiliary objectives that capture thematic and tonal characteristics of political discourse, achieving state-of-the-art performance on article-level ideology detection. Our approach demonstrates that explicit modeling of metalinguistic signals provides complementary information to content-based representations, particularly benefiting challenging classification scenarios such as center-leaning articles. All code for the experiments can be found on \href{https://github.com/upasanachatterjee/metalinguistic_features_in_political_bias_detection}{GitHub}.\footnote{Code available under the MIT license.}
